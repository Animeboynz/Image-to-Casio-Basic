# Image to Casio Basic

Why should the TI users have all the fun?

Want to display custom images on your Casio Graphing calculator?

Well, I did but unfortunately, I couldn't find a single other person who has done this for my calculator (Casio FX-9750GII).

So here's my attempt at it.

## Installation

Go to [Releases]() and download the latest one.


## Usage

Create a folder and have your image and the .exe inside it.

<img src="Images/1.jpg" alt="" width="270" />
<img src="Images/1.jpg" alt="" width="270" />
<img src="Images/1.jpg" alt="" width="270" />
<img src="Images/1.jpg" alt="" width="270" />
<img src="Images/1.jpg" alt="" width="270" />
<img src="Images/1.jpg" alt="" width="270" />
