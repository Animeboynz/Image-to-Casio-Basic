# Image to Casio Basic

Why should the TI users have all the fun?

Want to display custom images on your Casio Graphing calculator?

Well, I did but unfortunately, I couldn't find a single other person who has done this for my calculator (Casio FX-9750GII).

So here's my attempt at it.

<img src="Images/Image 1.jpeg" alt="Image" width="600" />

## Installation

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/Animeboynz/Image-to-Casio-Basic/releases) and download the latest one.


## Usage

1. Create a folder and have your image and the .exe inside it.
2. Open the executable and select your image file.
3. This program will first convert it into B&W and resize it to fit your calculator.
4. Pick your preferred image from the options that it provides.
5. Save it to a location.
6. Open CASIO-FA124, paste the output program and upload to your calculator

## Things to note
Clearing the screen before starting to draw is advised
(SHIFT + VARS, F6, F1, F2)

Some images might output code too long for a single calculator program (as casio has a limit for how many lines each program can have) so just split it into 2 programs and dont clear the screen between them and it should work fine.
